I'd been wanting to try adding fish to my <a href="just_like_stuffed_baked_potatoes.html">Just Like Stuffed Baked Potatoes </a>(JLSBP) for a long time. When I saw 2-pound bags of frozen Swai nuggets for only $2.99 a couple weeks ago, I thought they'd be just the thing to use for my idea. That's $2.99 for the whole bag; not per pound. This week they've got them for $2.49 but I'm not sure yet if I will buy more. There was something a little odd about the fish. Much of it seemed to be chunks of fat and skin but I guess that explains the cheap price. However, there was plenty of edible meat for this casserole. While this does taste pretty good, I think I prefer to have my fish separate from my JLSBP. This might be good with canned tuna but I really like my <a href="tuna_rice_casserole.html">Tuna "Rice" Casserole</a> and would rather make that.

You can cook the fish using any method you prefer. I broiled mine with 3 tablespoons of butter for about 10-15 minutes. I didn't count the butter in the recipe counts because you don't have to use it. Be sure to season the fish before cooking it. You could use fresh cauliflower instead of frozen. I'm not sure how much to recommend because you'll get a lot more from a head of fresh cauliflower than from a bag of frozen, which has a lot of excess water. The counts are based on using frozen.
